# How to submit a link for content that you think should be in the [ShortRuby Newsletter](https://newsletter.shortruby.com)


1. Go to Issues
2. Choose New Issue
3. Select Content Proposal Get Started
4. Fill in the Title and the body with the link to the resource you propose
5. Fill in anything else you think I should know (optional)
6. Click Submit New Issue

I will review this for the next edition and decide whether to include it in the newsletter.

I cannot promise I can explain why your content is not included. 
It might be good content, but maybe there are too many options in a specific edition.
